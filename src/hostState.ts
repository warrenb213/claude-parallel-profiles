/**
 * The extension's persistent state, kept on THIS host's disk.
 *
 * Why not globalState
 * ───────────────────
 * `context.globalState` looks per-host but is not: VSCode stores it on the CLIENT
 * (the machine running the UI), so every remote host an editor connects to reads
 * and writes the very same copy. Everything kept here describes one host's
 * filesystem — account stores are paths on it, the repo map is keyed by folder
 * paths on it — so sharing it across hosts is meaningless at best. At worst it is a
 * war: each host's reconcile prunes every account whose store isn't on ITS disk,
 * which is every account of the other host, and whichever host looks next re-adds
 * its own and prunes the rest. Windows on both sides kept losing their account and
 * reloading, back and forth, for as long as both hosts were in use.
 *
 * A file under ~/.claude-windows is shared by exactly the windows that share the
 * disk it describes — every window on this host, and no window anywhere else. It
 * is also read fresh on every access, so windows on the same host agree on the
 * account list without waiting for a restart.
